      <h2>Kinshuk Joshi</h2>
      <p>Hello Everyone! I am a student of IIT Kanpur currently pursuing BTech in Electrical Engineering. I'm the secretary of our college's Robotics Club. I’m passionate about robotics from my childhood. I always get fascinated by remote control toys and I love when they work on my gestures. I also enjoy assembling stuffs and wires and building a robot of my own.</p>Besides that I also want to contribute to the growth of the club and represent my college in various competitions like the prestigious Inter IIT. These develop my skills while contributing to the field I'm excited about.

  <div class="project">
    <img src="autonomous navigation.jpg" alt="Line Follower Bot" />
    <div>
      <h3>Autonomous Navigation</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on developing a fully autonomous mobile robot using the TortoiseBot platform. The objective is to enable the robot to explore an unknown environment, create a real-time map using SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), and navigate efficiently to user-defined goals using path planning algorithms within the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <img src="ball balance.jpg" alt="Voice Controlled Arm" />
    <div>
      <h3>Ball Balancing Bot</h3>
      <p>In this project we will build a robotic system that can balance a ball on a flat platform using two servo motors and a Raspberry Pi. A camera mounted above the platform will track the ball's position in real time using computer vision, and a PID control algorithm will adjust the platform angle to keep the ball centred. We'll learn to combine hardware, software, vision and control in one exciting hands-on build.</p>

 <div class="project">
    <img src="hexapod.jpg" alt="Voice Controlled Arm" />
    <div>
      <h3>Hexapod</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on designing and testing the control and locomotion system of a hexapod robot. The robot utilizes an RC-based communication system to execute smooth walking and obstacle-climbing maneuvers. Various gait patterns are implemented for efficient movement and enhanced stability on uneven terrain. The ultimate goal is to develop a terrain-adaptive hexapod suitable for real-world applications and research in robotics and mobility.</p>

<div class="project">
    <img src="turk.jpg" alt="Voice Controlled Arm" />
    <div>
      <h3>Mechanical Turk</h3>
      <p>The Mechanical Turk was historically a machine that appeared to play chess autonomously, but in reality, it had a chess master hidden underneath, secretly controlling its movements. As engineers, it’s much more feasible (and fun) for us to build a robot that actually plays chess. So if you ever feel that playing chess over the board is far more satisfying than playing online, come pay the Turk a visit!</p>

  <div class="project">
    <img src="step.jpg" alt="Swarm Robots" />
    <div>
      <h3>StepXplorer</h3>
      <p>Autonomous & Adaptive: In this project, we will build a stair climbing bot. It can detect and climb stairs on its own using ultrasonic sensors</p>Balanced for Purpose: The robot will also have a strong and stable platform to carry things while moving. It will stay balanced even when going over rough or uneven surfaces
